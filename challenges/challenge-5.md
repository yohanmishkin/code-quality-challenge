# Trim your branches

Run git branch -r. Marvel at all the old tracking branches that have been left in your local repo.

Run git remote prune origin to delete the local tracking branches that donâ€™t exist on origin anymore. You might want to throw a --dry-run on there to confirm that git is going to do the right thing.

Re-run git branch -r. Better, right?

Now that your local repo is clean, take a look at the branches on origin by running git ls-remote --heads origin.

Delete any of your branches that are no longer needed with git push origin --delete old_branch.

Maybe bug your coworkers to do 4 and 5, too.
