# Improve your README

Why? Because it serves as your project’s welcome mat. A good README will save you time and frustration when new people join your project (as internal team members, or open-source contributors). It also serves as the sales pitch for your app or library.

Here are some ideas of things to add to your README to flesh it out:

If your codebase is a library:

    The philosophy behind your tool
    Its place in the ecosystem
    A comparison to other similar libraries
    Lots of usage examples (it’s hard to have too many of these)
    Animated gifs

If your codebase is an app:

    What role does it play?
    How is it deployed?
    Who on the team should people go to with questions?
    What credentials are needed?
    How do they install/boot/deploy/develop it?
    What’s the development process?

For any project:

    FAQs
    Where should bugs be filed, and how?
    Who should be asked for PR reviews? (Are PRs welcome, generally?)
    How do you run tests?
    Is there CI?
    Screenshots
