# Improve a name

[link](https://forum.codequalitychallenge.com/t/day-15-improve-a-name/815)

Improve one name today. Any name.

It can be a class name, a method name, a variable name, a constant name, a file name, anything.

If you just thought of a name you know needs improving, do that one.

If you can’t find a name that could be improved, consider these questions:

    Do you ever refer to the same concept slightly differently in different spots?
    Have you noticed anywhere where a previous rename missed a few references?
    Pop open your schema. Are your database columns named consistently? (This is just a special case of the first one.)
    Is the name you’d use to describe a concept to a coworker the same as what’s in the code?
    Is the name your customers would use the same as what’s in the code?
