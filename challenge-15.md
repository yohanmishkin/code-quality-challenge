# Automate some repetitive action

[link](https://forum.codequalitychallenge.com/t/day-19-automate-some-repetitive-action/820)

Here are a few ideas:

    Create a bin/deploy script to handle any tasks that you always perform before/after deploys. (One post-deploy task I like to include: open production in my browser to make sure I didn’t just hose it somehow.)
    Create an alias for shell commands that you type frequently (git commands are good candidates). Here are my zsh aliases7 for more inspiration.
    You know that thing you do all the time that makes you think “there has to be a better way”? Dig into that and see if you’re right.
    Find a way to save yourself some keystrokes.

In general: find something you do at least a few times a week and see if you can make it more pleasant. Think of it as sanding down the rough edges in your development environment.

I think you’ll find this one quite satisfying. When I automate an annoying task, I get a little burst of dopamine each time I use my new, improved method to accomplish it. One-time effort; continuous payoff.
